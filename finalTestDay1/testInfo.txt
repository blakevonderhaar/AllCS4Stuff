go to the session page   localhost:3000/session

The session page should display the user's name.

The session page should have a logout button that when selected
will end the session and take you to the login page.
When logged out, you should not be able to get to the session page using localhost:3000/session

but selecting Create or Display should cause no action other than take you back to the login page.

that will add to a collection named infos when the Create
button is selected.  An error alert dialog should be displayed
if there is an invalid ident or name or if the ident has already
been added to the collection.
