Access your server with port 3000 by entering localhost:3000 as the url.

You must enter a valid index (0 and larger).
You must enter a non-empty name for object.
Color and rating can retain their default values or can have modified values.

When you select the gorilla submit button, object, color, and rating need
to be stored in an array on the server at the location of the chosen index.

If you enter localhost:3000/info as the url, and put in a valid index and
select the gorilla submit, then the object, color, and rating should be filled 
in from the data of the matching index of the array that was stored on the server.

The rating number and range should be in sync.
