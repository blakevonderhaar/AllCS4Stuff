Bring up command prompt and go to project folder.

You can start the server by doing either
>node bin/www
or
>npm start

==================================

Go to heroku.com to and create an account.

If you have admin privileges go to https://toolbelt.heroku.com
and download heroku-cli-x64.exe and run it.  This will install heroku toolbelt and Git.

or if you do not have admin privileges then you will have to "jimmy rig" heroku toolbelt by
copying the Heroku and Git folders that are provided.


>set PATH=%PATH%;full_path_to_git\Git\cmd;full_path_to_heroku\Heroku\bin

>git config --system http.sslcainfo "full_path_to_git\Git\mingw64\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt"

===================================

Upload your web app to the heroku web host.

Bring up command prompt and go to project folder.

>heroku login

>git init

>git add .

>git commit -m "First commit"

>heroku create

Save the url path that is provided.
Ex)   https://fathomless-dusk-52926.herokuapp.com


>git push heroku master

The above pushes the code to heroku so now you can go to a browser and run the web app live
by putting in the url path from the heroku create command.

====================================

After making changes to your web app, you can push up your latest code by doing the following.

Bring up command prompt and go to project folder.

>git add .
>git commit -m "Another change"
>git push heroku master











=================================
When setting up your own web app, you need to copy and modify the folders and files
bin, .gitignore, Procfile, package.json, app.js

.gitignore - the folders and files for git to ignore for commits.
----

Procfile - used for heroku.
web: npm start   - npm start is the command that will be executed to start the web server.

----

package.json - important to have 

  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },

because npm start will look for this in the package.json file to determine how to start the server.

Also important to have dependencies since node_modules was not uploaded to heroku.

------

bin/www - generated using   exppress-generator

make sure app matches app.js or change to match ????.js

not sure if need to change var debug .....    line of code

where did bin/www come from???

create a express project template by typing in a command prompt
express -help
express --view=ejs  myapp
cd myapp
npm install
npm start

in browser type for url    localhost:3000
